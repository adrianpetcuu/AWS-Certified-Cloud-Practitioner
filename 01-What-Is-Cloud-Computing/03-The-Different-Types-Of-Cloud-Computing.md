# 3️⃣ The Different Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing can be categorized based on **how the infrastructure is deployed** and **who has access to it**.

These are called **Cloud Deployment Models**.

---

# 1. Public Cloud

A Public Cloud is owned and operated by a third-party cloud provider.

Infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networking is managed by the provider and shared across multiple customers.

### Key Characteristics

- Infrastructure is shared (multi-tenant environment)
- Accessible over the internet
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- No hardware management required

### Advantages

- No upfront infrastructure costs
- High scalability
- Global availability
- Fast deployment

### Example Use Cases

- Web applications
- Development and testing environments
- Startups and small businesses
- Applications with variable traffic

---

# 2. Private Cloud

A Private Cloud is dedicated to a single organization.

It can be hosted:
- On-premises
- Or by a third-party provider

The infrastructure is not shared with other companies.

### Key Characteristics

- Single-tenant environment
- Greater control
- Higher customization
- More responsibility for management

### Advantages

- Increased security control
- Custom infrastructure configuration
- Suitable for strict compliance requirements

### Example Use Cases

- Government institutions
- Financial institutions
- Large enterprises with regulatory requirements

---

# 3. Hybrid Cloud

A Hybrid Cloud combines:

- On-premises infrastructure (Traditional IT)
- Public cloud services

Both environments work together.

### Key Characteristics

- Data and applications can move between environments
- Flexible architecture
- Balanced control and scalability

### Advantages

- Gradual cloud migration
- Keep sensitive data on-premises
- Use cloud for scalability

### Example Use Cases

- Backup and disaster recovery
- Seasonal workload scaling
- Regulatory compliance scenarios

---

# 4. Multi-Cloud (Modern Strategy)

Multi-Cloud means using services from multiple cloud providers.

Example:
- One provider for compute
- Another provider for analytics

### Benefits

- Avoid vendor lock-in
- Best-of-breed services
- Increased resilience

| Model        | Infrastructure Owner | Shared? | Scalability | Control Level |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Public Cloud | Cloud Provider      | Yes     | High       | Moderate     |
| Private Cloud| Organization        | No      | Limited    | High         |
| Hybrid Cloud | Mixed               | Mixed   | High       | High         |
| Multi-Cloud  | Multiple Providers  | Yes     | High       | Varies       |
