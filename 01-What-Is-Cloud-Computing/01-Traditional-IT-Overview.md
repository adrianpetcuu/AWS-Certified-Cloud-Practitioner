# 1️⃣ IT Traditional Overview

Before Cloud Computing, companies managed their own IT infrastructure in a traditional on-premises model.

## What Does “On-Premises” Mean?

On-premises (on-prem) means that all infrastructure is physically located inside the company’s data center or office building.

The company is responsible for:

- Purchasing physical servers
- Setting up networking equipment (routers, switches, cables)
- Managing storage systems
- Providing electricity and cooling
- Ensuring physical security
- Installing operating systems
- Installing and maintaining applications
- Handling backups and disaster recovery

## Infrastructure Layers in Traditional IT

In a traditional environment, a company manages the full technology stack:

1. **Networking** (cables, switches, firewalls)
2. **Storage** (hard drives, storage arrays)
3. **Servers** (physical machines)
4. **Virtualization** (if used)
5. **Operating Systems**
6. **Middleware**
7. **Runtime**
8. **Applications**
9. **Data**

Everything is the company’s responsibility.

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

Traditional IT requires large upfront investments.

Examples:
- Buying servers
- Building or renting a data center
- Purchasing networking hardware

This is called **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)** — paying for infrastructure before you actually use it.

## Challenges of Traditional IT

### ❌ High Upfront Costs
You must predict future demand and buy hardware in advance.

### ❌ Scaling Is Slow
If traffic increases, you must:
- Order new servers
- Wait for delivery
- Install and configure them

This can take weeks or months.

### ❌ Overprovisioning
To handle peak traffic, companies often buy more hardware than needed.
Most of the time, those resources remain unused.

### ❌ Maintenance Overhead
Hardware failures, upgrades, and patches require dedicated IT staff.

### ❌ Limited Global Reach
Expanding to another country requires building or renting a new data center.

## Risk Management in Traditional IT

Companies must plan for:

- Hardware failures
- Power outages
- Natural disasters
- Backup strategies
- Redundant systems

All of this increases complexity and cost.

## Summary

Traditional IT gives companies full control over infrastructure, but it comes with:

- Large upfront investments
- Limited flexibility
- Complex maintenance
- Slow scalability

These limitations led to the evolution of Cloud Computing, which shifts infrastructure management to a cloud provider.
