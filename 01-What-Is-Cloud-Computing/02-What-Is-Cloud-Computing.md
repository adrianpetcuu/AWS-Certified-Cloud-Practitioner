# 2️⃣ What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers, you access computing resources from a cloud provider whenever you need them.

---

## Simple Definition

Cloud Computing allows you to:

- Rent servers instead of buying them
- Store data without owning storage hardware
- Run applications without managing physical infrastructure

You only pay for what you use.

## Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

According to the industry definition, cloud computing has five essential characteristics:

### 1. On-Demand Self-Service
Users can provision resources automatically, without human interaction with the service provider.

Example:
You can launch a virtual server in minutes.

---

### 2. Broad Network Access
Resources are available over the internet and accessible from various devices.

Example:
You can access cloud applications from a laptop, phone, or tablet.

---

### 3. Resource Pooling
Cloud providers serve multiple customers using shared infrastructure.

This is called a **multi-tenant model**.

---

### 4. Rapid Elasticity
Resources can scale up or down quickly based on demand.

Example:
If website traffic spikes, you can instantly add more servers.

---

### 5. Measured Service
You are billed based on usage.

Example:
- Pay per hour of compute usage
- Pay per GB of storage used
- Pay per data transfer consumed

---

## Why Cloud Computing Became Popular

Cloud computing solves many traditional IT problems:

- No large upfront investment
- Faster deployment
- Global reach
- Automatic scaling
- Reduced maintenance

It transforms IT spending from:

**CapEx (Capital Expenditure)**  
➡️ into  
**OpEx (Operational Expenditure)** — pay only for what you use.

## Cloud Service Models (High-Level Overview)

Cloud services are commonly divided into three categories:

### IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
You manage applications and data.  
The provider manages hardware.

### PaaS – Platform as a Service
You manage your application code.  
The provider manages infrastructure and runtime.

### SaaS – Software as a Service
The provider manages everything.  
You simply use the application.

## Cloud Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud** – Infrastructure owned by a cloud provider.
- **Private Cloud** – Dedicated infrastructure for one organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud** – Combination of on-premises and cloud.

---

## Summary

Cloud Computing is a modern approach to IT infrastructure that provides:

- Flexibility
- Scalability
- Cost efficiency
- Global availability

Instead of managing hardware, organizations focus on building and delivering applications.
