# IAM MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your AWS account.

Instead of logging in with only a password, you must provide:

1. Something you **know** → Password  
2. Something you **have** → Temporary code (from a device)

---

## 🔐 Why MFA Is Important

Passwords can be:
- Stolen
- Guessed
- Leaked

MFA protects your account even if your password is compromised.

---

## 📱 How MFA Works

When logging in:

1. Enter username and password  
2. Enter a 6-digit code generated by:
   - Authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
   - Hardware token
   - SMS (less recommended)

The code changes every 30 seconds.
